This data comes from the London Fire Brigade. 

A panel of Fire service managers and local politicians want to better understand some particular aspects of the costs and response times 
associated with incidents during the time period in the data.

The specific request are:

1. The costs of responding to fires and false alarms
  The panel would like to know the sum of all costs associated with responding to fires during the time period, 
  and (separately) the sum of all costs associated with responding to false alarms. 
  
  They would also like to know the average (mean) cost of responding to a fire, and of responding to a false alarm.

2. The distribution of response times
  The panel ask that you provide a visualisation showing response times (as indicated in the ‘FirstPumpArriving_AttendanceTime’ variable) to all incidents 
  where there was indeed a response.
  
  In addition, they would also like for you to provide an additional version of the plot that allows for them to easily compare the distribution of 
  response times for the three different types of incident (“Fire”, “False Alarm” and “Special Service”, as indicated by the ‘IncidentGroup’ variable).

3. Summary of special service response times
  For this part you should use only special service incidents.
  
  The panel ask that you provide the values below, separately for each type of special service (as indicated by the variable ‘SpecialServiceType’): 
  
  A count of the number of each type of incident The mean response time for each type of incident The 10th percentile of response times for each type of incident The 90th percentile of response times for each type of incident
  (Note that for section 2, these should be presented in an appropriate table format)

4. A t-test comparing Ealing and Greenwich
  Use a t-test to compare the mean response times in Ealing to those in Greenwich.
  
  You should report the results using Null Hypothesis Significance Testing, and the estimation approach.
