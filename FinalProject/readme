I am delighted to present a comprehensive report that delves into the critical realm of food safety and its impact on public health. 
This project entails an in-depth analysis of local authorities' efforts in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland to ensure establishments comply with hygiene and food safety laws. 
The key focus lies in understanding the outcomes of intervention actions and their effectiveness in maintaining public well-being.

The provided dataset encompasses valuable information, featuring one row for each local authority and the respective establishments within. 
These establishments have been rated based on their potential impact on public health, using letter grades ranging from A to E. 
These ratings signify the extent to which they may pose a risk to public health if they fail to adhere to proper food safety standards.

The primary objective of the project is twofold:

1. Distribution Analysis: I have curated informative plots that illustrate the distribution of successful enforcement actions across the Local Authorities (LAs). 
I provide two distinct versionsâ€”one combining all impact levels and another segregating the distributions for establishments rated A, B, C, D, and E. 
These visuals offer a clear perspective on the effectiveness of intervention actions in mitigating potential health risks associated with different establishment categories.

2. Investigating Relationships: I have thoroughly examined whether an increase in professional enforcement officers influences the likelihood of establishments successfully responding to enforcement actions. 
This exploration involved studying the correlation between the proportion of successful responses and the number of FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) food safety employees in each local authority. 
Additionally, I have explored the relationship between the proportion of successful responses and the number of employees in proportion to the total number of establishments in the local authority. 
This bespoke measure provides insights into the concentration of food safety employees per establishment, offering valuable insights for policymakers and managers.
