The data comes from Food and Safety Agency.

I investigated whether establishments successfully respond to intervention actions. I also created my own measure of how many food safety employees FSA should employ to achieve high succesful intervention rate.


Second dataset comes from publishing company. The management would like to understand several factors that contribute to the book sales.
