This data comes from the London Fire Brigade. 

A panel of Fire service managers and local politicians want to better understand some particular aspects of the costs and response times 
associated with incidents during the time period in the data.

The specific request is addressed in R and written in Rmarkdown file. Finally, the report is knitted to HTML file.
